I co-teach a variety of courses and workshops centered around using __R__ for time series analysis. Here are some recent examples.

During winter quarters of odd years, [Eli Holmes](https://faculty.washington.edu/eeholmes/), [Eric Ward](https://faculty.washington.edu/warde/), and I teach [_Applied Time Series Analysis in Fisheries and Environmental Sciences_](https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/fish203/35553/243766) (FISH 507) in the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/) at the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/). 

In March of 2014, [Eli Holmes](https://faculty.washington.edu/eeholmes/) and I taught [_Applied Times Series for Ecology_,](https://timeseriescourseemb.wordpress.com/) a weeklong short course in the [Department of Ecology, Environment and Plant Sciences](http://su.se/deep/english/) at [Stockholm University](http://www.su.se/english/).
